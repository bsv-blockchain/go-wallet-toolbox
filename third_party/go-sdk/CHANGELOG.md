## [1.2.22] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- `overlay/lookup`: `HTTPSOverlayLookupFacilitator.Lookup` now correctly handles `application/octet-stream` binary BEEF responses returned by overlay nodes. Previously, binary responses caused a JSON decode error, which prevented SLAP host discovery and caused all overlay broadcasts to fail silently with `ERR_NO_HOSTS_INTERESTED`.

### Changed
- `overlay/lookup`: `HTTPSOverlayLookupFacilitator.Lookup` now sends `X-Aggregation: yes` on every lookup request, aligning with the TypeScript SDK behaviour.

## [1.2.21] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- Overlay broadcaster: fixed distinction between `RequireAckAll` and `RequireNone` based on empty topic array (#302)
- Overlay broadcaster: error responses no longer trigger admittance checks — only 200 OK responses are evaluated (#302)

## [1.2.15] - 2026-01-27

- Missing ARC status constants: `MINED`, `CONFIRMED`, `DOUBLE_SPEND_ATTEMPTED`, `SEEN_IN_ORPHAN_MEMPOOL`
- Test coverage for fee calculation with `TestCalculateFee`

### Changed
- Arc broadcaster refactored with `ArcBroadcast` abstraction for better error handling
